   ```

2. **Run Setup Script (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   ./setup-github.sh
   ```

3. **Or Manual Setup**
   ```bash
   # Create GitHub repo at https://github.com/new
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/microservices-devops-assessment.git
   git add .
   git commit -m "Complete microservices DevOps assessment submission"
   git branch -M main  
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. **Share Repository URL**
   - Provide GitHub repository URL to assessors
   - Mention that it's ready for code quality review
   - Optional: Offer to demo locally if requested

## 💡 **Assessment Notes**

**For Code Review Only:**
- No additional configuration needed
